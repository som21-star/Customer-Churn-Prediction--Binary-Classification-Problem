# Customer-Churn-Prediction--Binary-Classification-Problem
Churn prediction is one of the most well known applications of machine learning and data science in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Marketing fields. Simply put, a churner is a user or customer that stops using a company’s products or services.  Churn applications are common in several sectors:  Subscription business companies (think internet and telephone services providers): customers that are most likely to churn at the end of their subscription are contacted by a call center and offered a discount. E-commerce companies (think Amazon and the like): automatic e-mails are sent to customers that haven’t bought anything for a long time, but may respond to a promotional offer.
