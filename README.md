# Customer-Churn-Prediction--Binary-Classification-Problem
Churn prediction is one of the most well known applications of machine learning and data science in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Marketing fields. Simply put, a churner is a user or customer that stops using a company’s products or services.  Churn applications are common in several sectors:  Subscription business companies (think internet and telephone services providers): customers that are most likely to churn at the end of their subscription are contacted by a call center and offered a discount. E-commerce companies (think Amazon and the like): automatic e-mails are sent to customers that haven’t bought anything for a long time, but may respond to a promotional offer.
This is a binary classification problem. I used python libraries and Jupyter Notebook. I got an accuracy score of 84.16% on the validation set using Logistic Regression model and Recursive Feature Elimination technique. I have uploaded all the relevant files(e.g. The Dataset: Bank Customer Churn Modeling). Thank you.
